## <ins>About Me</ins>
As a data analyst with a background in sales, online marketing and product management, I am experienced in the life cycle of sales in products and services and learned how to efficiently plan several short-term projects with overlapping deadlines. This combined with being a fast learner in the use of computer tools makes that I understand business key factors in one or several connecting datasets quickly and that I can translate them to business solutions and opportunities.

In my last job as a data researcher I discovered my interest in data and I want to use this expertise in an interesting junior data analyst, BI specialist or data consultant position for 32 hours a week, at a company I am passionate about: one that makes social or environmental impact as their main business goal. 

Over the years I have developed strong communication skills with both stakeholders and colleagues, which comes in good use when communicating critical insights through data visualizations, storytelling and reporting. 

Having lived in 6 countries has shaped who I am, both in life and work experience. I speak Dutch, English, Spanish and French and I have a broad vocabulary in Flemish.

#### The tools that I use: Python, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, PowerPoint
